# CityScope Repository
Arrange a Meeting with Ira Winder [jiw@mit.edu] before making any commits to this repository.

## Intro
CityScope Repository is a collection of sketches developed with Processing IDE, largely to serve the "CityScope" platform
[http://cp.media.mit.edu/city-simulation](http://cp.media.mit.edu/city-simulation)

## Setup
1. Clone Repository to your machine
2. Download latest version of Processing 2 from Processing.org and set its preferences such that the Sketchbook location is the *CityScope/Processing/* Folder. ( We use Processing 2 since CityScope uses some libraries which have not yet migrated to Processing 3 )
3. Re-start Processing 2.  Now all of the sketches should show up under File>Sketchbook>

## Useful Tips
* **Colortizer** takes a webcam input of colored tags and turns it into a matrix of IDs & rotations passed via UDP
* **Legotizer** takes input from Colortizer and *legotizer_data/* folder to rebuild a digital model of the table.  It also sends and receives heatmap data from CitySim.
* **CitySim** takes JSON data of a point cloud received from Legotizer and does matrix math on it.  It tells Legotizer when it is done.
* **CityScope/Misc/** folder containes helper sketches and in-progress sketches.
* **DO NOT** edit the following folders needed to run Processing:
	* *CityScope/examples/*
	* *CityScope/libraries/*
	* *CityScope/modes/*
	* *CityScope/tools/*

## Documentation
CityScope scripts in the repository are compiled and tested with Processing IDE 2.2.1 on Windows 7:

As of January 12, 2016, the following Processing libraries are required.  These should be kept up to date in the repositoryâ€™s *CityScope/Processing/libraries/* folder:
	* **OpenCV** by Greg Borenstein (Colorizer, Legotizer)
	* **Keystone** by David Bouchard (Legotizer)
	* **UDP** by Stephane Cousot (Colorizer, Legotizer, CitySim)
        * **DDPClient** by [Yasushi Sakai](https://github.com/yasushisakai/processing-ddp-client) (Colortizer,Legotizer)
